# The current discussion will be devoted to constants and their role in the program and project. While writing the
# program, it is important to understand which values should be made constants, because if necessary, you will need to
# change the value only in one place, and not throughout the code. And this is not to mention how much clearer the code
# will be without "magic numbers". It is also important to name constants differently if they have a different essence,
# but the same value, for example, both are equal to 5. By the way, the values 0 and 1 can often be allowed to be used.
# not as constants.

# Example №1
# Context: The constant in the example contains the bot telegram token, which is used to authorize the bot when
# requesting the telegram API to work with bots.
# Comments: Following the rules of naming constants, all the letters of the constant were converted to uppercase,
# the name itself as a whole correctly reflects the essence of abstraction.

# WAS
...
telegram_bot_token = "18423654403:KSKDFKkuasfafuohsdf"  # fake token
...

# BECAME
...
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN: str = "18423654403:KSKDFKkuasfafuohsdf"  # fake token
...

# Example №2
# Context: The constant given in the example contains the identifier of the Telegram chat in which the moderators of
# the project consist.
# Comments: The main edit that I am making here is the translation of letters into uppercase in accordance with the
# rules for the design of constants.

# WAS
...
moderators_chat_id = -635182071
...

# BECAME
...
MODERATORS_CHAT_ID: int = -635182071
...

# Example №3
# Context: the presented constant contains the identifier of an English-language chat
# (there is also a Russian-language one), which is a closed chat where people who have passed moderation are added.
# Comments: In addition to the fact that I brought the constant into the proper form (uppercase),
# I also slightly modified the name so that the constant better reflects the essence, especially considering that
# using numbers in variables is undesirable practice.

# WAS
...
vip_chat_num1 = -1001548750662
...

# BECAME
...
VIP_CHAT_EN: int = -1001548750662
...

# Example №4
# Context: the presented variable contains the ID of the chat in which the main stakeholders of the project
# (company local chat) consist.
# Comments: As part of the program, it was decided to rename the name of the constant to a more concise name,
# fitting in one word all those who are in the chat.

# WAS
...
cf_bot_group_chat_id = -652708298
...

# BECAME
...
STAKEHOLDERS_CHAT_ID: int = -652708298
...

# Example №5
# Context: The variable responsible for this identifier (in the telegram it is called chat_id) displays a unique
# number that is assigned to the bot, by which it can be identified.
# Comments: Given that the variable contains the word 'chat', it is quite a difficult task to make it clear to the
# reader of the code that in this sense 'chat' is exclusively the term telegram. Therefore, it was decided to use the
# merged spelling of the term 'CHATID', it would also be nice to add some decoding of the concept as a comment.

# WAS
...
bot_telegram_id = 1848637403
...

# BECAME
...
BOT_CHATID: int = 1848637403
...

# Example №6
# Context: The specified variable contains the basis for compiling a so-called deep link, into which additional
# information can be encoded, and the user will not only go to the bot, but also, for example, the bot will find out
# from which source the user came.
# Comments: During the refactoring of the name, it was decided to give preference to the term "Interface" when
# describing the essence of the variable, since the part of the link that the variable represents is in fact not
# suitable by itself and requires the addition of a co-operative part.

# WAS
...
bot_start_deep_link_base = "https://t.me/preTesting_bot?start="
...

# BECAME
...
BOT_DEEP_LINK_INTERFACE: str  = "https://t.me/preTesting_bot?start="
...

# Example №7
# Context: During the calculation of the task in the light of aviation, the compilers of the task were given a
# certain constant, which contained a certain standard deviation within the framework of the task that had
# to be provided for.
# Comments: Therefore, within the framework of the program, I renamed the value of the variable and using the word
# 'standard' thereby showing that the variable is named about the deviation rather than about some fatal error.

# WAS
...
error = 0.12
...

# BECAME
...
STANDART_ERROR: float = 0.12
...

# Example №8
# Context: In the constant below, we encode the port on which the 'FiftyOne' application will run - an open source
# toolkit that enables you to build better computer vision workflows by improving the quality of your datasets
# and delivering insights about your models.
# Comments: If this code is read by a person who does not know that 'FiftyOne' is just such an application, then he
# will be confused why this constant is explained, so I added a little certainty to the name of the constant.

# WAS
...
FIFTYONE_PORT: int = 5151
...

# BECAME
...
FIFTYONE_APP_PORT: int = 5151
...

# Example №9
# Context: The constant given in the example is responsible for the path along which the logs and weights of the
# machine learning model are stored.
# Comments: The original name is not expressive and looking at it, you might think that it is not about the path for
# temporary files, but about the temporary path, I have corrected this moment.

# WAS
...
TMP_PATH: Path = Path('./tmp') / uuid4().hex
...

# BECAME
...
TMP_FILES_PATH: Path = Path('./tmp') / uuid4().hex
...

# Example №10
# Context: In a small game, from which the example is taken, there is always a fixed number of cells of the playing
# field, which never changes during the execution of the program.
# Comments: Before refactoring, the number 100 was a 'magic number', so I entered a constant into the program
# reflecting this value.

# WAS
...
for cell in range(100):
    cell.check_status()
...

# BECAME
...
NUM_GRID_CELLS = 100
for cell in range(NUM_GRID_CELLS):
    cell.check_status()
...

# Example №11
# Context: During scraping, it is necessary to give the scraper the correct headers, previously in the script the
# header was directly declared during the request.
# Comments: However, since the same header is given to the scraper everywhere, which does not imply changes,
# it was decided to make it a constant.

# WAS
...
# the constant was not declared
...

# BECAME
...
HEADER: dict = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/94.0.4606.81 Safari/537.36'}
...

# Example №12
# Context: Earlier in the course, the number 60 was explicitly specified as the number of seconds after which it
# is necessary to request updates from the server.
# Comments: Earlier in the course, the number 60 was explicitly specified as the number of seconds after which it
# is necessary to request updates from the server.
