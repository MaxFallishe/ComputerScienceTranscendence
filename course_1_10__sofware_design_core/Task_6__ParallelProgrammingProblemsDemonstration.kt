// In the implementation of the "RaceConditionExample" class, you can see a clear example of the consequences
// of the "race condition" problem. Due to the fact that threads randomly access the variable and may not have time
// to perform both reading the value from memory "counter = 92", and calculating "92 + 1", and saving the new value "counter = 93",
// not all iterations of increasing the number will be applied. However, if we want to make sure that a variable
// is atomic and threads also act with it as with atomic, we need to explicitly designate this. For example, in FixedRaceConditionExample
// was used an AtomicInteger, not regular Int.
